# Salary Calculator
Salary Calculator

## Description

This app allows you to plan your monthly cost for any number of employees based on a user provided budget. The app requires a budget input and all employee fields must be filled out. If these requirements are met, the employee is added to the employees grid. The 'total monthly:' box below tracks the total monthly spending based on each employees annual salary, and if the monthly spending exceeds your budget the box will turn red. Each employee has a delete me button that removes them from the grid and updates the 'total monthly' spending.
